# moodle-multilang-span-generator
A program that helps you generate multilang text with ease

Tweaking to specific languages
------------------------------
Instead of taking the language code as input, replace the first few lines with the below snippet:
```
    string lang1 = "en";
    string lang2=  "ar";
```
The language code itself could be different.

Running the program
-------------------
If you do not have experience running a C++ program before, the easiest way to run this would be to go to http://cpp.sh/ and paste the code in the IDE.

Once pasted, press run and type the inputs in the 'Execution' window displayed on screen.
